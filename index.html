        <h3>Favourite vacation spot</h3>
        <h3>Kashmir</h3>
        <p>Kashmir is a beautiful place in India. 
            It's in the northern part, surrounded by <b>mountains</b>. 
            People there speak different <b>languages</b>, 
            and it has been a place of conflict for a long time. 
            Some want it to be part of <b>India</b>, 
            while others want it to be independent or part of Pakistan. 
            The region has a <b>rich culture</b>, with delicious food and **beautiful scenery**, 
            but the conflict has made life difficult for many people who live there.
